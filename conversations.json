Losing someone's money and the strain it puts on your friendship is a heavy burden.  You're right to feel guilty, it was a mistake, and it's important to take responsibility for your actions.\n\nHere are a few thoughts that might help you:\n\n* **Acknowledge your mistake sincerely:**  Reach out to Hareesh and express genuine remorse. Tell him you understand why he's upset and take full responsibility for what happened. Avoid making excuses.\n* **Offer to make amends:**  Even if you can't replace the money immediately, propose a plan to do so. Maybe you can offer to pay him back in installments or find ways to earn the money to return to him.\n* **Be patient:**  Hareesh may need some time to process his feelings. Don't pressure him to forgive you immediately. Give him space and allow him to come to terms with the situation at his own pace.\n* **Learn from your experience:**  This situation can be a valuable learning opportunity. Reflect on what led to you losing his money and how you can avoid similar mistakes in the future.\n\nRemember, true friendship can withstand challenges. While it might take time, if you are sincere in your apology and efforts to make amends, there's a chance Hareesh will forgive you.

It shows empathy for his feelings.\n* **Repaying the money:** This demonstrates your commitment to taking responsibility for your actions and making amends. It shows you value his trust and the friendship.\n\n**Will he accept it?** That depends on Hareesh and how close you are. Some people might be more understanding, while others might need more time or a guarantee of repayment.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. **Reach out sincerely:** Apologize directly to Hareesh, expressing your guilt and regret. \n2. **Explain your plan:** Tell him you want to repay the money and outline how you plan to do it (e.g., installments). \n3. **Be patient:**  Give Hareesh space to process.
